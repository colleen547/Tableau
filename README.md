CitiBikeData.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook was created in order to combine and inspect csv files downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html. Using glob, multiple csv files were combined using 8 lines of code (see source in .ipynb file for reference) and saved into one file named combined_csv.csv.

To inspect the data, a dataframe was created to determine the size and dimenions of the data, rename columns, determine data types and check for null values.
